    "# Remaining data-cleaning tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in [the last notebook](./1_data_preparing.ipynb), we've now removed all legitimately-missing values and all outliers.  What remains is to fill in the \"missing\" values with \"DNE\" (Does Not Exist) or with 0 as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we tell that a missing value means \"DNE\" or \"0\" rather than actually being missing?  The [data description](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt) sheds light on this.  For example, it says that the variable `Alley` is supposed to take on 3 values: 'Grvl', 'Pave', and 'NA.'  However, the vast majority of observations are have missing values in this column.  But: we see that among all observations in the data set, *only the values 'Grvl' and 'Pave' appear in the column `Alley`*!  This implies that what the data dictionary indicates as \"NA\" means \"We left this value blank.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So to eliminate missing data problems, we'll want to automatically fill in with \"DNE\" (Does Not Exist) any missing values that have this property.  That is, if a categorical variable is listed in the data dictionary as being able to take on the value \"NA\" and furthermore has missing values, then we'll check whether that variable has achieved the full number of categories it's supposed to (according to the data dictionary).  If not, then we'll automatically fill its missing values with \"DNE\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we construct a dictionary of all the categorical variables that the data description lists as being able to take on the value \"NA\" or \"None\", and for each such variable we list the number of different values (including \"NA\") that that variable is supposed to be able to take on.  Since there are relatively few values that each of these variables can potentially take one, in a data set of 2000+ observations we should expect to be able to find examples of each of these values being taken on, *unless* the value \"NA\" was encoded as a missing value.  So to test whether one of these categorical variables is (likely to be) *missing values only because of the encoding method and not because they were legitimately missing*, we will simply compare the number of values that that variable takes on in our data set to the number it's *supposed to* be able to take on according to the data description.  If the number of values taken on is less than the number claimed by the data description, then we'll assume that any missing values should properly be understood as \"DNE\" (Does Not Exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the numeric variables, it's impossible to use this method to check whether a value is \"legitimately\" missing: the possible values that the numeric variables can take on are not listed in the data description, as there are infinitely many of them!  Instead, if a variable represents a quantity that could possibly be 0 in some homes (e.g. 'Wood Deck SF', if the home doesn't have a wood deck at all), then we'll just assume that any missing data corresponds to a value of 0.  We construct a list of all such numeric variables below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method seems reasonable since (a) the previous notebook only uncovered 11 total data points (out of more than 2000) that could not fit with the idea of missing data points simply being a shorthand way of recording \"Does Not Exist\", and (b) this data set has a lot of categorical variables with missing values, but we will find (using the test mentioned 2 paragraphs ago) that *none* of these values are legitimately missing (other than those 11 removed in the last notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are a few variables representing the year in which something took place (e.g. `Year Built`, `Garage Yr Blt` and `Yr Sold`).  Since this is a data set of *homes that were built and then sold*, there is no reason for us to assume that a missing value in `Year Built`, `Yr Sold`, or similar categories represents a \"not legitimately missing\" value.  However, the variable `Garage Yr Blt` is the unique one where there is strong reason to believe that a missing value indicates not a \"truly missing\" value, but instead a way of encoding \"Does Not Exist\".  Indeed, some homes do not have garages!  For this reason, we will fill any missing `Garage Yr Blt` values with \"DNE\".\n"
